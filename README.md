## 1. [Television Ratings Analysis](https://github.com/bintrim1/television-ratings-analysis)
This project focuses on a thorough analysis of data from the entertainment industry. It focuses on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999, with the release of The Sopranos. The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows released during the "Golden Age" of television also have the most votes.

## 8. [Customer Churn Forecast](https://github.com/bintrim1/customer-churn-forecast)
This project explores the nuances of customers from Beta Bank. Little by little, they are leaving every month. The bank figured out that it is cheaper to keep existing customers rather than attract new ones. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to analyze customers' behavior and termination statuses, and predict whether or not a customer will churn. We are aiming for a final F1 score of 0.59 or higher.
